# Creating-A-Snake-Tail-Trail
These scripts make a snake like tail or trail for people stuck out there

# The Actual Tutorial

-First create a prefab for the tail Sprite. I would recommend a square

-Add the `MarkerManager` script onto it

-Now create another Game Object and add a `Rigidbody2D` and the `Snake` script to it

-Now you will see an empty list in the inspector called `BodyParts`

-Add the prefab that you just created as many times as you want, ( this indicates the length of the tail )

-If you want you can completely scrap the Movement and Rotation from the `Snake` script and create your own, because mine is pretty bad
